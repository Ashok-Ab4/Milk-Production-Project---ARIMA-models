## Milk-Production-Project---ARIMA-models

#### Data gathered from a public forum. First the data is subjected to some minor cleaning.

#### Plots are then generated, first a basic plot and then some for the rolling means. 

#### Decomposition plots generated for trends and seasonality. 

#### Data is then tested for stationarity followed by differencing calculations and visualizations, to observe changes in time periods and seasonal differences.

#### Autocorrelation plots are then generated plotting the time series against itself lagged by 1 time unit. 

#### The ARIMA model is then used for forecasting future produciton rates.
